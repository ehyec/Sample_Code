Problem1 program called The Drunkard's (Random) Walk works correctly. For example, it an user inputs 2 as the starting avenue integer and 5 as the starting street integer, the result would be 5 blocks form start based on the current location, 6 avenue and 6 street. 

The second problem, Credit card number validation, also works well. For testing, an user inputs 480760521766 and 409434602754 given the example, the result prints valid. If the starting number of credit card is 3, it would be errorCode 1.
